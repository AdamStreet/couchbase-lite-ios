// the array is the primary key and secondary key. and the ordering is based on that. the ordering in the index is purely for performance.
// generally, stick to one property in the index.
// For FTS it doesn't make any sense.

// the Ã± example for now
/*:
 ### Full-Text Search Query
 - Running a full-text search query is similar to a normal query. The difference is that the result row type is `FullTextQueryRow` which has additional methods.
*/
let hotelSearchQuery = Query
                        .select()
                        .from(DataSource.database(database!))
                        .where(Expression.property("description").match("'seafront sea'"))

    if let ftsRow = row as? FullTextQueryRow {
        print("hotelSearchQuery :: \(ftsRow.fullTextMatched!)")
    }
}
// any time the match operator it runs FTS and returns FullTextQueryRow

// SQLite FTS4 has special DSL like '' and * to make the search for granular
// if we talk about it since it diverges from N1Ql
